<P>Where is JC Denton? 
<P>
<P>Previously thought to be in Hong Kong, working with the terrorist, infamous hacker, and Chinese mobster Tracer Tong, it now appears he has managed to escape the grasp of the authorities.  Top agent Gunther Hermann of UNATCO is said to be on the case.  There are further worries his equally destructive brother may have recovered from a brush with the law and may even now be plotting with JC.

<P>
<P> * New York- but is he stupid enough to return?
<P> * France- More allies for his campaign of terror
<P> * Antarctica- would make him easier to nuke!

<P>The Screws say to Gunther: “Happy hunting!”
