<P>Frank,

<P>I'm starting to get annoyed.  The new security chief (I can never remember his name) thinks he can boss me around.  Today he "ordered" me to stay in my quarters because of some supposed security threat.  As if he's somehow above me.  What a pathetic little man.  I think my first order of business when the new order comes is to have him killed.
