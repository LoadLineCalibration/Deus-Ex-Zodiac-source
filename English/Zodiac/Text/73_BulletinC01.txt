<P>The low gravity research laboratory incorporates a recent breakthrough in technology: the ability to create an artificial anti-gravity field.
<P>
<P>Currently, the technology is not quite capable of simulating zero gravity, and only small fields can be generated.  However, it has already proven quite useful in researching the effects of low gravity on human B lymphocyte cells, without requiring a costly space-based laboratory.  The goal is to address the health issues of astronauts exposed to zero gravity environments for long periods.
<P>
<P>Tours of the laboratory are available to Tier 4 employees and above, as well as major shareholders of Page Industries, Inc. from 9:00 am to 3:00 pm.  You may sign up for a tour at the reception desk in the front lobby.  All participants will be required to sign a liability waiver.  The tour is not recommended for pregnant women or those with heart conditions.
