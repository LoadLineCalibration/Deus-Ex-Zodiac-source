<P>Dr. Abrams,
<P>
<P>Recently Dr. Okun has begun pestering us again about access to the biomatter.  I agree with your assessment that we should be focusing our efforts on one area of research at a time.  I know you think I'm paranoid, but something tells me that he's up to something.  I suggest making sure each of the samples is secure.  The last thing I want to see is him getting grand ideas and leading us in several directions.  Our resources are too limited to be spread that thin.
<P>
<P>Dr. Andrews
