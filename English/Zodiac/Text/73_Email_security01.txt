<P>To all security supervisors:
<P>
<P>We have received confirmation that unauthorized personnel have recently been spotted inside the facility, so have your staff be on the lookout for anyone not wearing a security badge.  There have been a few reports indicating possible use of cloaking gear, so be sure to put at least one officer per shift on thermal scanning duty.
