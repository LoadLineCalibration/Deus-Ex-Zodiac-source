<P>The biophysical origins and potential functions of a variety of rhythms generated in different parts of the brain--the hippocampus, thalamus, and cortex--are associated with different behavior states such as attention, motor activity, and sleep. These rhythms have now been tentatively linked to processes of learning, memory, and the binding together of aspects of perception.
