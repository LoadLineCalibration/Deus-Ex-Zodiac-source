<P>There are a few rules Holloman members need to know if they've ever thought about taking their family to the dining facility.
<P>
<P>With a variety of meals available in the dining facility, service members and their families have many options for a nutritious meal.  But some restrictions do apply.
<P>
<P>The Shifting Sands and Westerner dining facilities provide meals at a small price to enlisted personnel, officers, retirees, Department of Defense civilians, and their dependents alike.  Yet there are restrictions as to who can use those facilities, how much they pay for meals, and when they're allowed to eat there.
<P>
<P>According to Tech. Sgt. Gina Tremmel, 49th Services Squadron food service NCOIC, people are sometimes confused about usage of these facilities.
<P>
<P>"While we want to satisfy E-1s through E-9s, it's our main priority to make sure we take care of the Subsistence in Kind customers first," said Tremmel.
<P>
<P>SIK is the meal plan for airmen grades E-1 through E-4 who live in dormitory housing, and Army personnel who are stationed at Holloman.
