<P><DC=255,255,255>Richard Cobbett reveals the true Government Plot behind "Carbon 60"
<P>
<P>It would no doubt surprise Harold Kroto, and his fellow Nobel Laureates Robert Curl and Richard Smalley, that their seemingly innocent discovery of Buckminister Fullerene, commonly known as "Buckyballs" would be manipulated to create a new and precise weapon for the USAF.
<P>
<P>Using the carbon spheres, which form in the shape of a European Football, and combining them with next generation RALTI (Radar and Laser Target Acquisition) technologies, scientists at Dryden's Air Force base have created a beam so precise, it has the potential to target any organic compound to a distance of 0.2mm. 
<P>
<P>When questioned by PARANORMAL MONTHLY about the work involving Buckyballs at DAFB, a spokesman, "Buck" Turdigson, gave this response: "The USAF, in cooperation with NASA, is investigating the potential usage of buckyballs in future space missions. This research is geared toward creating a room-temperature superconductor, and not some kind of fantasy death ray." He added that "Peace is our profession." 
<P>
<P>Once more it seems, the Government seeks to draw a veil of secrecy over its privately funded developments of terror weapons; designed to scare the population into obedience of a New World Order. Perhaps a little revolution now and then isn't such a bad idea after all. Citizens! Read! See! Remember!
