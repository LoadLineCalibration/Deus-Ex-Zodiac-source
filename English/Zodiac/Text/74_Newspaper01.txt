<P>Mead Says War May Be Inevitable
<P>
<P>During yesterday's press conference, President Mead shocked the world by declaring that a direct confrontation with China may be inevitable.  Seemingly oblivious to the gasps of the reporters, he continued by stating that China's recent assaults against Taiwan would not be tolerated and would be dealt with in the harshest possible manner.
<P>
<P>When asked how far the U.S. would be willing to go, he answered: "Whatever it takes.  We have a sizeable fleet deployed in the region, including six aircraft carriers and I have ordered every military installation in the country to go to Threatcon Delta, our highest level of military alertness.  We're ready.  If China does not comply with UN Resolution 1581 within ten days, there'll be hell to pay."

<P>Mead has been widely criticized by members of both major political parties for his decision to provide Taiwan with large amounts of weapons grade plutonium-239, essentially making them a nuclear power.  Critics claim that Mead's decisions have exacerbated tensions between China and Taiwan and his haste in mobilizing military force could lead to disaster.

<P>A subcommittee lead by Senator Isaac Bowles has been formed to investigate possible impeachment proceedings.
