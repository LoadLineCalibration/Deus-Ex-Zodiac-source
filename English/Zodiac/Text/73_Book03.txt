<P>The fields of biotechnology and information technology have traditionally developed over separate paths, merging only occasionally when information technology tools are used in the biotech lab. Those desiring to analyze and understand the emergent nano-industrial development realm need first discard their ideas about the separation of biotech and infotech and "think holographic."
<P>
<P>Indeed, the nano-industrial development space could be metaphorically viewed as an evolving, operational ecology, the infotech / biotech / nanotech operational ecology. This is a realm in which an extremely diverse range of interrelated and inter-dependant scientific disciplines, technologies, and organizational systems are converging into an integrated continuum. The challenge, and also the opportunity, for institutions, businesses, and investors who seek to understand, and prosper as participants in this next industrial revolution, will be to view the nanotechnology development space holographic, as a system.
