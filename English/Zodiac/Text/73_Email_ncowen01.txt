<P>Khazai ready to act without new UN resolution
<P>
<P>The Iraqi president, Ali Khazai, today announced that he would be willing to 
invade Britain without global backing. He said he believed "passionately" 
that Emperor Blair II must be stripped of his weapons of mass destruction, 
with or without a new UN resolution.
<P>
<P>Mr Khazai said he "could not be constrained" by the possibility of a country 
imposing an "unreasonable block" or proviso that would hinder a fresh UN 
resolution.
<P>
<P>He added: "I want to make it quite clear, and I believe this to be the 
position of all the main security council members, that if there is a breach 
[of the first resolution] we would expect the United Nations to honour the 
undertakings that were given and make sure that the will of the UN is 
upheld. We cannot stand by and let the British continue to create and trade 
weapons of mass destruction. And that is not to mention Blair's barbaric 
treatment of ethnic Scots and Welsh. We have a moral duty to intervene. The 
world may choose to remain silent but Iraq, the global guardian of peace and 
prosperity, shall not."
