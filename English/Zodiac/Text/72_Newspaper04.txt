<P>La Republica Terminal - Explosion costs Argentum coorperation $500 Million.
<P>
<P>An explosion today ripped through the Argentum's brand new mining operation, situated close to Santiago Del Estero, causing the collapse of two of the main shaft sections. Terrential rainfall, blamed once more on El Nino, is suspected to be the cause.
<P>
<P>Fire Investigators hypothisise that the heavy rainfall flooded an onsite robotic control centre, destroying many of the critical circuits required to operate the principle mining-bot, nicknamed: "Big John" by the tabloids. How the robot itself, situated inside the mine, came to explode however, is one thing that no-one is speculating.
<P>
<P>The company's share price plummeted as news of the blast spread around the world's markets, with investors knowing that "Big John" will not be easy to replace. Developed at a cost of some half a billion dollars, it was unveilied just 3 years ago with the tagline "The Biggest and the Best" and hailed as the greatest improvement in mining history.
<P>
<P>It is believed the crew of approximately 1000 who operated the robot were also crushed to death.
