<P>As one of the few individuals at the facility with security clearance UMBRA, it is imperitive that you do not mention the existence of the G2-7Z computer core.  It contains an extremely sensitive archive of data about the organization.  And I think you know that I'm not talking about the CIA.
<P>
<P>This key will give you access to the elevator that leads down to the computer core.  However, you will still need a keypad code to use the elevator itself.  For security reasons, that will be provided in a separate document.
<P>
<P>The door to the computer core is in the cafeteria kitchen, believe it or not.  We usually refer to it as "The Fridge".  I hope I don't have to spell it out any more than that.
