<P>
<P>The International Monetary Fund completed its weekend conference in Washington, D.C., but not before police arrested 2,600 people protesting the Fund and the World Trade Organization (WTO). 
First, police seized materials that they said could be used to make firebombs and closed the training center for protestors Saturday.  But thousands of activists, bearing backpacks and bravado, gathered in the rain and vowed not to be deterred from shutting down the meetings of the world trade organizations on Monday.
<P>
<P>Despite human blockades and demonstrations by as many as 20,000 people, protestors failed to stop the first day of meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
