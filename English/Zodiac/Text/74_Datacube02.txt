<P>Diary entry 1:
<P>
<P>I have no idea what day it is, but I think I've been here for several weeks now.  They keep us heavily sedated most of the time, which is disorienting.
<P>
<P>During the last cell inspection, I managed to steal a DataCube and a nanokey from the guard without him noticing.  Whoever these ZODIAC people are, they certainly are loyal, but some of them aren't too bright.  I'm going to start a diary using this Datacube as a way to try maintaining some level of sanity.  I'm already finding it comforting for some reason.
<P>
<P>If you are reading this, it probably means that I took one too many chances and got my stupid ass caught.  It also means that I'm probably dead.
