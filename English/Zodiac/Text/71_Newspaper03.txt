<P><JC>Mead Concludes Visit to China</JC>
<P>
<P>President Mead today returned from his visit with Chinese President Zhu Dongxiao.  According to sources, his hopes of smoothing tensions were met with hostility and anger.  China has threatened trade sanctions with the U.S. following a U.S. shipment of weapons-grade plutonium-239 to Taiwan.

<P>Press Secretary Mitchell said, "We're confident that this situation can be resolved without it escalating into a global concern. But the President will not allow China to invade Taiwan under any circumstances."

<P>Many analysts agree that Mead's decision to essentially make Taiwan a nuclear power was unwise.
