<P>Good work picking up that suspicious character, J. It turns out his name was Augusto Puzo, a spy for the rebels. We couldn't get much info out of him and I can't be bothered to wait for that specialist interrogation equipment to make it down here.

<P>We threw him in the greasel tank. When you get the chance, get a few guys to grab some remains (the code is 2354) and deposit it downtown where the terrorists will find them. A sight of a gibbed comrade may be enough to detract them from pulling any more of those stunts until our mop up operation is in full swing. Watch out for those greasels, drug them but don’t kill them. They are quite useful pets.

<P>S.
