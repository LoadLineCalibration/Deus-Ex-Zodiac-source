<P>All contractors are cordially invited to this year's company picnic on the 18th of next month.  You may bring two additional guests.  Tickets are available for 38 credits per guest.  It is expected that any time spent at the picnic be made up at a later date, as that time is not billable.  Casual dress will not be permitted.
<P>
<P>See you at the picnic!
