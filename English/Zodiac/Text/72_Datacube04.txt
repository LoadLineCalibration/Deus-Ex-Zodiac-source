<P>Moira,
<P>
<P>I can't take the pressure any more.  It's obvious that the higher ranking MJ12 people want me out of the organization.  For some reason they've given me access to very sensitive data.  It's almost like they want me to know too much so they have an excuse to kill me.  Yes, some of them have a very strange way of thinking.
<P>
<P>I'm constantly watching my back.  I'll often go days without sleeping.  And when I do sleep, I keep having the same nightmare: an agent wearing therm-optic camo sneaks into my bedroom and slits my throat.
<P>
<P>These days, I'd like nothing more than to deny them that pleasure.
<P>
<P>Ernesto
