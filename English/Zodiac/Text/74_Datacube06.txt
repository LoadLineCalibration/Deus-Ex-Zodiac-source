<P>Jack,

<P>Warner has declared sub-level four off limits, but if there's a gas leak or something down here, I'm getting out.  And we all know that the elevator shaft down there leads right up to the surface - it's the quickest way out of here.  They've probably locked down the elevator up to the surface, but if something happens, I'm at least going down to four.  I'd suggest you do the same.  The code to get to level four is 2953.
