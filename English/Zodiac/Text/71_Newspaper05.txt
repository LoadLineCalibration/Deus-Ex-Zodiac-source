<P><P>APR - Beijing, China
<P>
<P>In a statement on March 15, Chinese Premier Nghia Lam said that China will not tolerate "Taiwan independence" and that the Chinese people are ready to shed blood and sacrifice their lives to defend the unity of their motherland and the dignity of the Chinese nation. 
<P>
<P>"Our consistent principle on the settlement of the Taiwan question has been 'peaceful reunification' and 'one country, two systems', but we do not promise giving up the use of force to  resolve the Taiwan issue," the premier said. 
<P>
<P>The premier rebuffed the presumption that China dare not use  force to resolve the Taiwan question. "Some people are calculating how many aircraft, missiles and warships China possesses, and have concluded that China dare not and will not use force (to resolve  the Taiwan issue)," he said. "According to such kind of calculation, Hitler would long have ruled the whole world." 
<P>
<P>"People making such calculations don't know about the Chinese history. The Chinese people are ready to shed blood and sacrifice their lives to defend the unity of their motherland and the dignity of the Chinese nation," Lam stressed.
