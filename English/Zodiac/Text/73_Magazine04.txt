<P>In a recent interview, we asked John Marcack, the project leader of the PS9 game Satanic Ritual 3, why games have yet to acquire a mainstream audience.  "Uncompromising games will never reach mainstream status. The average person makes a lot of false assumptions when they see a title like Genocide Online, Cannibal Slaughterhouse 2052, or one of our Serial Rapist expansion packs for the Satanic Ritual line. They are unable to look past the cosmetic trappings of the games and experience the artistic vision that the gameplay embodies. And that's because they are idiots."
