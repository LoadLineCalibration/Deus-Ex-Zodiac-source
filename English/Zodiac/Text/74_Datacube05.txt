<P>I'm writing this message in the hope that someone from the outside will find it.  You must help us.  Most of the scientists down here are being forced to work on research that is clearly to be used for unethical purposes.
<P>
<P>Our families have been threatened and three of my colleagues have already been killed for refusing to cooperate.
<P>
<P>I've been pretending to play along and will try to get access to the Nuclear Transfer Array Lab.  I believe that is where the most important research is being kept.  It must be destroyed.

<P>If I do get access to the NTA lab, you may be able to find more information in my e-mail.  Go to my desk (Ron Morris) and use this ID and password: RMorris, enzymes.
