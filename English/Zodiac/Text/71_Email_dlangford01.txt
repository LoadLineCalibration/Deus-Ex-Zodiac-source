<P>Susan,
<P>
<P>I overheard some people with strange looking I.D. badges in Operations the other day.  They mentioned a keypad that accesses a sector I've never even heard of.
<P>
<P>The code is 2501, which seems to have some sort of significance.  Something about The Puppetmaster.  Mean anything to you?  I'm just curious, since that sector isn't on any floorplans that I have access to.
<P>
<P>Dave
