<P>UN Security Resolution Leaked
<P>
<P>The emergency summoning of the United Nations Secuity Council this afternoon has been thrown into chaos after a private memo was leaked to the BBC. The leaked document revealed an apparent plan by the United States and United Kingdom to propose full sanctions on the Chinese, and also mentioned "surgical strikes" against both Chinese radar and SAM installations, and "extensive operations" at sea.
<P>
<P>The Chinese ambassador to the United Nations refused to comment on the leaked document, however its release prompted an angry response from the British representitives, who dismissed it as "Nothing but a sham and a phony". The US commitee declined to comment.
<P>
<P>China seems to have reacted militarily to this leak almost instantly, with the number of tracked combat aircraft over the East China sea having doubled. The presence of the US Naval taskforce, and its combined air armada of some 400 aircraft, seems to have dampened neither Chinese resolve or optimism, and the Chinese pilots firmly believe they can eliminate the US force, consisting of not only the aircraft, but a naval fleet of around 80 ships.
<P>
<P>Chinese reservists have been fully mobilized also, and so, despite UN pressure, and the threat of Taiwanese nuclear missiles, an invasion army totalling an estimated 3 million men seems to poised to strike in the largest amphibious operation since the Yucatan Channel invasion of Cuba in 2008.
