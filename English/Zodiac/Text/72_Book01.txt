<P>The Bilderberg Hotel of Buenos Aires
<P>
<P>This is a recommended visit for all tourists visiting this part of the coast, even if they lack the funds to actually stay in it. The incredible expense of this hotel has meant that its main use has always been hosting large business meetings and some political events. The hotel was constructed in 2008 as part of the WTO funded redevelopment of Argentina; indeed the whole area is still partly owned by that helpful organisation.
<P>
<P>It is one of the few examples of the neo-medieval style which achieved mild popularity among new constructions from 2005 to about 2018. The white walls symbolise the fresh start given to Argentina by the world while the castle-like fortifying walls represent the strong relationship between the US and Argentina. It was noted by some onlookers when the structure was unveiled that the obelisk, a scale copy of the one that is the symbol of Buenos Aires, resembled a giant phallus, hopefully preparing to burst forth with precious lucre from the investments made by the WTO.
