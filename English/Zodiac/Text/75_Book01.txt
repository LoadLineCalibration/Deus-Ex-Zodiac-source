<P>DIARY
<P>
<P>This morning Major Vaughn asked yet again about the tunnel ventilation maintenance area.  I wish he'd just leave it alone.
<P>
<P>If only he knew that I'm trying to protect him.  He's a good man and I'd hate to see him get caught up in all of this.  Hell, I wish I didn't know as much as I do.  And all I know is that it ain't no maintenance corridor.  I don't even know what it is they do down there, and frankly I don't want to.
