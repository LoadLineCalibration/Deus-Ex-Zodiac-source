<P>Further Escalation of Taiwan Crisis
<P>
<P>The spiralling tensions over Taiwan today forced both sides to step up another level, bringing the two Asian countries anther step closer to all out war. In a daring daylight raid, two Chinese bombers, reported to be Russian in origin, penetrated the complex radar defenses of Taiwan's navy, and successfully reduced a command and control (C&C) center to rubble on the Penghu islands.
<P>
<P>Taiwanese defenses, hailed as "impenetrable" by President Luck sin Yu, seemed to have only discovered the aircraft as soon as the bombs were falling. President Mead gave a muted reaction to these events after his morning engagement seeing the so-called "Plague Orphans", in a Free Clinic in the heart of New York's "Hell's Kitchen" area.
<P>
<P>Reports indicate that the center destroyed was a major relay station, connecting land, air and sea forces through a complex series of satellites. The tit for tat cycle of strike bombings and naval assaults seems as yet to be stalling any full on conflict between these two nuclear powers, but despite UN insistance on a cease-fire, this seems as far off as ever.
