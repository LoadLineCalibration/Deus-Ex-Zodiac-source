<P>Before our eyes lies an uncharted new landscape whose contours are being shaped in thousands of biotechnology laboratories in universities, government agencies, and corporations around the world.  If the claims already being made for the new science are only partially realized, the consequences for society and future generations are likely to be enormous.  Here are just a few examples of what could happen within the next twenty-five years.

<P>Animal and human cloning could be commonplace, with "replication" partially replacing "reproduction" for the first time in history.  Genetically customized and mass-produced animal clonses could be used as chemical factories to secrete -- in their blood and milk -- large volumes of inexpensive chemicals and drugs for human use.  We could also see the creation of a range of new chimeric animals on Earth, including human/animal hybrids.  A chimp/hume, half chimpanzee and half human, for example, could become a reality.  The human/animal hybrids could be widely used as experimental subjects in medical research and as organ "donors" for xenotransplantation.
