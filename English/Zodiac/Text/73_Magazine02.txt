<P>
<P><DC=255,255,255>John Walker reports on the sceptism surrounding the unveiling of "Aquinas"
<P>
<P>"Bandwidth, for all intents and purposes, is now free." Those very words were spoken by Bob Page earlier this week, when describing the setup of what has been hailed as the greatest technological achievement of the 21st centuary: Aquinas.
<P>
<P>Having seen the failure of two "unlimited bandwidth" systems within two years however, many people, including industry experts, believe it might be impossible to achieve this. Paranormal Monthly has investigated Bob Page's plans, and can now exclusively reveal that the system can only operate in one way: With the aid of Bio-Storage.
<P>
<P>We enquired to a PageNet spokesmen, and Mr. Page himself gave this reply: "Do you people never give up!  Aliens, MiBs, Little Green Men, anything to get a story. You're all paranoid! There is no bio-storage system. There is no conspiracy. Aquinas will suceed!"
<P>
<P>Another denial to add to Paranormal Monthly's books: Further proof that biological matter is being used for binary data storage; and that this will form the core of the Aquinas system. With Mr. Page's rather emphatic and emotional denial of this, we must draw the conclusion that an Unlimited Bandwidth system is possible. But only with Bio-Binary systems, and most probably, alien intervention.
