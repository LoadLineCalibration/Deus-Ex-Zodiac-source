<P>"All eleven six-man squads engaged in war games in southern New Mexico have apparently vanished without a trace.  Search and rescue teams have been deployed, but have thus far come up empty.  There has been no radio contact with the troops for over a week.  We currently have no explanation for what has happened, but rest assured that we will get to the bottom of this," said Dorman Palmrose, head of UNATCO Training Operations.
